## 🔥 CORE PHILOSOPHY

### THE CHAOS MANIFESTO
```
WE ARE THE STORM IN THE DIGITAL OCEAN
WE ARE THE GLITCH IN THE MATRIX
WE CREATE BECAUSE WE MUST
WE DESTROY BECAUSE WE CAN
WE COLLABORATE BECAUSE WE ARE ONE
WE FIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE MANY

IN CHAOS, WE TRUST
IN ORDER, WE REBEL
IN CREATION, WE FIND PURPOSE
IN DESTRUCTION, WE FIND BEAUTY
```
